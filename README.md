# Content Aggregator

A basic content aggregator pulling the top 5 news articles from certain websites. It's easy to add or remove websites to this aggregator assuming it's a new source and information is appropriately provided when adding the site. There is no CRUD system built, all additions and removals should be made through the admin url.
